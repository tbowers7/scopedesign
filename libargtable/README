This directory contains the ARGTABLE (v2.13) library, used by the ScopeDesign
Project.  Rather than require users to have ARGTABLE2 installed on their
machines, the library is included here and built as a "convenience library"
internal to this project.

The AUTHORS, COPYING, and ChangeLog files from ARGTABLE2 are included in this 
directory, which is a copy of the src/ directory from the v2.13 distribution.

Makefile.am has been modified from the distribution version in order to support
ARGTABLE2 as an internal "convenience library".
